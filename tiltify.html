				<p class="title_about">The reason I got into code in the first place is that I love a good challenge. I thrive when given a set of tools and told to make a vision into reality. The satisfaction that comes when you deploy a well built application is the same feeling of getting that last hit on the final boss (Ganondorf, for instance).</p>

		<h2 class="column_title"> About me </h2>
		<h3 class="column_sub">Who I am</h3>
		<p> I am a web developer passionate about creating apps to simplify challenges individuals face every day. The best thing for me is when the user gets their hand on the product and provides the feedback that then becomes an even more powerful program. I am a former top fundraiser from Boy Scout Troop 34 and was top seller for my FFA Chapter 3 years running. Fundraising is in my blood. The same love of technology that led me to begin coding also brought me to Twitch and livestreaming as a whole.<p><br>
		<h3 class="column_sub">Things I love</h3>
		<p>For the large number of hobbies I have, the one that shapes who I am the most is that I am a gamer. Be it tabletop, console, or PC a great many of my stories and adventures in life have a common thread: sitting down and playing games with a group of people. I absolutely love to travel and thanks to the Twitch community, I've taken several trips to PAX and TwitchCon, creating the chance to spend time with other gamers in new and exciting cities. I'm a trivia nerd and a movie buff. And whenever I have the downtime I especially love to just spend time hanging out with my rough collie, Belle and my cat, Arya.</p><br>
		<h3 class="column_sub">Why I'm here</h3>
		<p>I'm a born and raised Nebraskan. While I made a lap around the eastern half of the state growing up, I call Lincoln home at the moment but as I often like to explain, I will adapt to wherever life takes me. After a brief foray into Agricultural Economics, I realized that my personal passion was elsewhere and that's how I found web development. Coding provides an adventure that I've yet to find in any other career path. There's never a dull moment when there's always something new to be learned, be it a language, framework, operating system, or otherwise!</p><br>

		<h2 class="column_title">About you</h2>
		<h3 class="column_sub">You're changing an industry</h3>
		<p>Before Tiltify, fundraising on Twitch was a difficult process to get right. If you collected the money through a payment processor, people didn't get the credit they deserved from an organization. If you directed people to the organization or campaign's page, they didn't get the credit or recognition they deserved on stream. Then came Tiltify and your company provided an application that allows people to create a crowdfunding fundraising campaign with the ability to track funds raised, offer incentives, and most importantly provide on screen alerts based on donations received. Start to finish, your application does better in one place what streamers previously had to manage in several applications.</p><br>

		<h3 class="column_sub">You're looking for innovators</h3>
		<p>As Tiltify continues to grow, it needs people who are mavericks in their specialty. As the only company that does livestream fundraising, there's no roadmap to follow and every employee is forging a path through unexplored territory. More importantly, for Tiltify to maintain that growth, you need driven individuals who work hard and love to do it. The perfect match for the job wants to learn new skills and technologies for their own satisfaction and integrate that new knowledge into the code they write.</p><br>

		<h3 class="column_sub">Why we should talk</h3>
		<p>When Josh Belkin approaches me with an idea, I listen. And when Josh approached me with the information that you were looking for a junior developer, I got very excited. I'm exactly what you're looking for. I enjoy thinking outside the box, learning and adapting new technologies, interacting with those who use the product to build it more powerful yet easier to use with each patch. Live streaming, video games, and the supportive communities they create and passions shared between your company and me. Together we can create the next innovations in crowdfunded fundraising. </p><br>
